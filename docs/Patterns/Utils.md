### `CalculateDelaysFromDur(durations)`

Used to calculate delays when the `dur` argument is given tuples.
It replicates two events.

### `CalculateEuclideanDelay(durations)`

Calculates a pattern of durations and delays using nested
tuples/PGroups and the PDur algorithm -- currently not implemented.
