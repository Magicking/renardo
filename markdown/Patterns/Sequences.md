# `Sequences`

Sequences.py
------------
All patterns inherit from Base.Pattern. There are two types of pattern:

1. Container types
    * Similar to lists but with different mathematical operators
2. Generator types
    * Similar to generators but can be indexed (returns values based on functions)

## Classes

## Functions

### `PShuf(seq)`

PShuf(seq) -> Returns a shuffled version of seq

### `PAlt(pat1, pat2, *patN)`

Returns a Pattern generated by alternating the values in the given sequences 

### `PStretch(seq, size)`

Returns 'seq' as a Pattern and looped until its length is 'size'
e.g. `PStretch([0,1,2], 5)` returns `P[0, 1, 2, 0, 1]` 

### `PPairs(seq, func=<lambda>)`

Laces a sequence with a second sequence obtained
by performing a function on the original. By default this is
`lambda n: 8 - n`. 

### `PZip(pat1, pat2, *patN)`

Creates a Pattern that 'zips' together multiple patterns. `PZip([0,1,2], [3,4])`
will create the Pattern `P[(0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)]` 

### `PZip2(pat1, pat2, rule=<lambda>)`

Like `PZip` but only uses two Patterns. Zips together values if they satisfy the rule. 

### `PStutter(*args)`
