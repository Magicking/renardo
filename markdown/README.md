FoxDot Documentation
====================

FoxDot is a Python library and programming environment that provides a fast and 
user-friendly abstraction to the powerful audio-engine, SuperCollider. It comes 
with its own IDE, which means it can be used straight out of the box; all you need 
is Python and SuperCollider and you're ready to go!

For more information on installation, check out [the guide](http://foxdot.org/installation), 
or if you're already set up, you can also find a useful starter guide that introduces the
key components of FoxDot on [the website](http://foxdot.org/).

Please see the documentation for more detailed information on the FoxDot classes 
and how to implement them.
